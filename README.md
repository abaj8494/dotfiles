# Welcome to the DOTFILES!

Here lie the configuration files for some of my most extensively used programs. I hope you find some gems.

## nvim
An extensible text editor which I use to manipulate all text.

## tmux
My terminal multiplexer, without which I am lost.

## yabai
My window manager on OSX, hacky and extensible; especially with skhdrc.

## skhd
Allows integration of powerful keybindings with yabai^.

## lf
An extensible file manager written in GO. Very fast and configurable.

## mopidy
Runs the backend for my music. Co-ordinates between Spotify, Tidal, my personal library and even my CD-ROM.

## ncmpcpp
The TUI client to interface with above music. Very lightweight and configurable.

## sclirc
TUI for the signal messaging app. Written in Python and comes with an overhead. Saving grace is the VIM bindings.

## zathura
PDF viewer with sensible VIM bindings.

## torrentdl
Allows the indexing of magnet links from popular torrenting databases.

## neofetch
Typical system information with a couple settings tweaked.
